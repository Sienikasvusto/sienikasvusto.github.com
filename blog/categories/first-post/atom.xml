    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have started lots of blogs during my life and as you can probably guess, non of these lives no longer.</p>

<p>So how this time is different:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I’m writing english and that will cause shitloads of fails in the means of grammar (if you happen to be an english teacher or similar random grammar-nazi then you should worry)</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not sure but I think that this is first blog (and first time) when I was like (hate that “I was like”-structure but…) “I have to write somewhere about this”.</p></li>
<li><p>This is very tech-oriented blog as you can probably see from the title of blog.
Well as I previously said, I did have feeling that I have to write about it somewhere, so read my next post.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Few things about me.</h3>

<p>I’m 19 years old, nerd, not hipster, nice guy, photographer and coder.</p>

<p>As a side note I have my own company founded when I was 15 years old. It’s cloud related as you can guess. Apps for 2010-century I can say. I’m not gonna tell you about my company anymore but more about what I do with computers. So this blog is more personal. Blueprints of my life as a nerd.</p>
